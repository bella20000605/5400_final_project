"Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance.

And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air.

Darwin proposed that natural selection is responsible for the diversification of species. This pre-Darwin concept denies this. My understanding is that anti-evolutionists refused to accept that natural selection could have led to the diversification of species. Until recently, when they realized that evolutionary theory could help out in their how-many-animals-could-fit-on-the-ark dilemma; now they suddenly take an idea from evolutionary science and propose that suddenly all the present species could ""micro-evolve"" from a few ancestral ""kinds"" on the ark.",notsarc

Despite being autosomal, people appear statistically slightly more likely to exhibit balness if the trait comes from their mother's side of the family. Even if we knew precisely which genes were involved and which of those genes your kids had, we still cannot tell you the likihood of your children being bald. The chances of the gene combination being expressed in the correct way to cause baldness are dependent on age, hormone levels, stress and probably a variety of other environmental conditions.",notsarc

The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological.
